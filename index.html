          <h3>How Cool CSS Is</h3>
          <p>
            CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is an amazing tool
            that allows you to style your web pages with precision and
            creativity. It provides you with the power to transform your plain
            HTML into visually appealing and interactive websites.

          <h3>History of CSS</h3>
          <p>
            CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium
            (W3C). The main goal was to separate content from design, allowing
            HTML to focus on the structure and CSS to handle the visual and
            aural presentation. Over the years, CSS has evolved through several
            versions, with CSS3 being the most widely used version today,
            introducing modules, media queries, and more advanced selectors.

          <h3>Why CSS Was Created</h3>
          <p>
            Before CSS, HTML tags like <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> were used to style web pages, making
            HTML documents bulky and difficult to maintain. CSS was created to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Separate content from presentation, making HTML cleaner and more
              semantic.
            </li>
            <li>Allow for more sophisticated and flexible styling options.</li>
            <li>
              Enable web pages to adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cool Stuff You Can Do with CSS</h3>
          <p>
            CSS offers a variety of features that make web design both easier
            and more dynamic:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Styling:</strong> Change the look of your website by
              setting colors, fonts, and spacing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Layout:</strong> Create flexible layouts using techniques
              like Flexbox and Grid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Animations:</strong> Bring your site to life with
              transitions and animations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Make your site look great on
              any device with media queries.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With CSS, you can create visually appealing and interactive websites
            that enhance user experience.
